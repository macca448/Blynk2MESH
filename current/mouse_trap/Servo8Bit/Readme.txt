-Bug fix: If detach() was called on a servo then subsequent calls to attach() would fail.
The detach() function now works properly.

1) Make sure you have WinAvr installed (http://winavr.sourceforge.net/)
2) open a CMD window and navigate to the Servo8Bit folder
3) type in "make" in the CMD window and the code will be compiled
4) type in "make program" to program your Attiny. This assumes you are using a
